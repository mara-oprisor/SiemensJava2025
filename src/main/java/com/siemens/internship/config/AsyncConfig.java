 * This class enables the asynchronous support for the applications by allowing Spring to look for @Async annotations.
 * When it meets a method annotated with this annotation, it runs it on a background thread that comes from the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.
 * Therefore, the server can handle multiple requests more efficiently because it does not have to wait for the slow operations to finish.

     * Core pool size - how many threads are kept alive, even if theyâ€™re idle.
     * Max pool size - in case the queue gets filled, the max number of threads that can be allowed. (usually 2 * corePoolSize)
     * Queue size - when all threads from the core pool are busy, requests enter the waiting queue
     * Thread Name prefix - all treas will be called Thread-1, Thread-2 etc. Helps with debugging when looking through the logs
     *
     * All these arguments can be adjusted based on the problem and the average number of requests made.
     * (these are tests values that I estimated should be ok)
